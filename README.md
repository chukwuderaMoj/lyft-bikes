# Query Project

Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. I will be analysing the public data with the goal to suggest deals and offers to increase ridership.
  
I will answer these main questions: 

  * What the popular "commuter trips"? 
  
  * What are your recommendations for offers (justified based findings)?


To make my recommendations, I will need to perform data exploration, cleaning or filtering dirty data, etc. to provide supporting data for my recommendations. 

I be answering these business-driven questions using public datasets housed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and quering the data with SQL.
